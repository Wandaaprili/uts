  <span1>About:</span1>
  <p></p>
  <span2>My name is Farris Awadallah and I am currently a senior at the Piscataway/New Brunswick campus at Rutgers University. I am graduating with a major in Information Technologies and Informatics and with a minor in Digital Communication and Media.</span2>
  <span3>I am also graduating with a specialization in Game Production and Innovation and have a fair share of experience with programming and game design.  The skills I have gained from making games have taught me valuable lessons in programming, organization, flexibility, and teamwork.</span3>
  
  <span4>As for my personal life, during the weekends I have spent the last six and a half years working a part time job as a waiter at Sahara Restaurant in Montgomery, New Jersey. In my free time I enjoy a wide range of activities, such as playing and watching sports, playing video games, chatting with friends online and hanging out with local friends.</span4>
